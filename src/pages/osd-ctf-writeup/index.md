The Open Source Developers Community (OSDC) organized the OSD CTF 2019 in CyberSrishti, the annual techfest of JIIT, Noida. It was a 5-hour long Jeopardy type onsite CTF with around 35 teams registered for the event out of which 20 reported to the venue to play the game.

The CTF was deployed on the CTFd platform. Apart from a few network issues, the CTF ran smoothly and ended with `iamalsaher` from `Bharti Vidyapeeth College of Engineering` winning it with 750 points. Here, we have compiled the writeups of the 17 problems that we provided to the participant teams.
