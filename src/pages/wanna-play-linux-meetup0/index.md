Thus, to provide the community members an introduction to the command line and the various basic commands of Linux, OSDC organized the "Wanna-Play-Linux Meetup" on 30th August,2018.

It started with an introductory talk by [Himanshu Nailwal](https://github.com/crapsystem) about the six stages of using Linux and some basic Linux commands. Adding to this,in order to make the learning process more interactive,a customised live disk was created which contained 11 levels, each of which contained a flag/a password to the next level. The user had to find that flag using some basic commands like `cat` ,`ls -a`, `grep`, `find`,`tar` etc. to navigate his way to the next level and ultimately to the end. Bringing their hacking skills to the forefront, everyone and even the newcomers tried their best to decipher the flags level by level.

This approach of learning by doing was highly appreciated by all the community members.The meetup succesfully ended with a QnA session and a lot of awesome stuff learnt and done.
